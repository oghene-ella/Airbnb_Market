# Exploring NYC Airbnb MarketðŸš€

<h2>Brief Introductionâœ¨</h2>
Welcome to New York City (NYC), one of the most-visited cities in the world. As a result, there are many <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb listings</a> to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months.

<h3>The aim of this project is to analyse the dataâœ¨</h3>
My analysis will be focused on the followingâœ¨:
<ol>
  <li>What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?</li>
  <li>How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?</li>
  <li>How many adverts are for private rooms?</li>
  <li>How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?</li>
</ol>
