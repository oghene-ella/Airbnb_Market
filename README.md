# Exploring NYC Airbnb MarketðŸš€
<img src="./nyc.jpeg">
<h2>Brief Introductionâœ¨</h2>
Welcome to New York City (NYC), one of the most-visited cities in the world. As a result, there are many <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb listings</a> to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months.

<h3>The aim of this project is to analyse the dataâœ¨</h3>
My analysis will be focused on the following questions:
<ol>
  <li>What is the average price of an Airbnb listing per night in NYC?</li>
  <li>Compare the average price of an Airbnb listing, to the private rental market per month</li>
  <li>How many adverts are for private rooms?</li>
  <li>Compare Airbnb listing prices across the five NYC boroughs</li>
</ol>

_________________________________________________________________________________
<p>With my analysis, I was able to gain insight of the data; the questions above were answered!</p>
<h3>Here are my results</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The average price per night for an Airbnb listing in NYC is $141.82.\nI was able to do that by filtering the free listing (that is by removing the ones that had $0) and calculating the average of the remaining ones in the column.</li>
  <li>I was able to compare the monthly costs of airbnb listing which was: $4313.61; while in the private market one would pay $3,100.00 according to <a href="https://www.zumper.com/">Zumper</a> (as at 2019)</li>
</ol>
